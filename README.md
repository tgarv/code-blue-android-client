Overview
============
This was the client side Android application for a project during my senior year at MIT. It relies on an API that is no longer live, but the project used some interesting libraries (Google Cloud Messaging for real-time push notifications, location-based events using Google Maps) so it's here for reference. There are no compatibility or usability guarantees of any kind.
